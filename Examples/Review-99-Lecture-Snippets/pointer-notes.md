# C++ Variable Types (Quick Review)

  - pointer-type variable (e.g., Book* book_ptr)
  - reference-type variable (e.g., Book& book_rfc)
  - value-type variable (e.g., Book book_obj)

# C++ Member Function (Method)

```c++
    class Book
    {
        //...

        void setTitle(std::string ttl);

        //...
    }
```

# C++ Class Checklist

  - Interface completeness
  - const correctness
  - Big-3 (Copy Constructor, Destructor, Assignment Operator)

# Polymorphism and Abstract Base Classes

  - Inheritance
  - Subtyping

  - Dynamic Binding
  - virtual functions
  - pure virtual functions (abstract functions)
  - ABC (abstract base class)

# Pointers

  - raw pointers (the traditional pointer)
  - smart pointers

# New Tricks

  - Factory Pattern
  - Builder Pattern (hopefully)
  - More Iterator tricks

  - DRY & SO**L**ID with new stuff
